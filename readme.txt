How the result is achieved:

1.created a class file for basic CURD operations file name:poll.class.php
2. created a php file to make the case study in single entry point file name: index.php
3.created a php file to make the user to poll file name: opinion.html.php
4.created a php file to display the result file name: results.html.php

I have used browser session to check the poll vote for the same user.we can also do it through ip address.since to make it easy to test for now i have used browser session.To vote again, close the browser and now you can vote again.
